# TensorFlow2 - Image Classifier

This example builds upon the components in the [GPT-2 Tensorflow](gpt-2/) example and deploys an Image Classifier exported using TensorFlow 2.

The classifier leverages a small [transformer](gpt-2/transformer.md) to either accept a base64-encoded image or URL, which is then downloaded by the transformer. Step-by-step instructions are not available for this example, however the deployment process is identical to the steps used in the [GPT-2 Tensorflow](gpt-2/) example.
