# Get Started with CoreWeave

## Obtain CoreWeave access credentials

On CoreWeave, **Kubeconfig** files are used to interact with our Kubernetes cluster by using clients such as `kubectl`, and **API Access Tokens** are used for programmatic access to CoreWeave Cloud applications such as [Prometheus](prometheus/).

To generate your access credentials, first [sign up for CoreWeave Cloud](https://cloud.coreweave.com/request-account). Once you have an account, [log in to the Cloud UI](https://cloud.coreweave.com), then navigate to the **API Access** page from the left-hand menu.

### Generate the Kubeconfig file

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Warning**

**The Kubeconfig and Access Token is shown and given** **only once!** Be sure to save this file and the token in a secure location. If you lose your Access Token, it can be found inside your Kubeconfig file.
{% endhint %}

From the [API Access page](https://cloud.coreweave.com/api-access) on the Cloud UI, click the **API & KUBECONFIG** tab at the top right of the page, then click the **Create a New Token** button to the right.

When prompted, give the token a recognizable name, then click the **Generate** button. Generating the new token will also create a Kubeconfig file with the name `cw-kubeconfig`, which will embed your token. This file will download automatically.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

If you would like to prevent the Kubeconfig file from downloading automatically, un-check the **Automatically download Kubeconfig** checkbox.
{% endhint %}

## Install the Kubernetes command line tools

Once you have obtained your Access Credentials, download the Kubernetes command line tools.

**Additional Resources**

For more information on Kubernetes installation and configuration, please reference the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

{% tab title="Linux" %}
## Installing `kubectl` on a Linux system

****

**Downloading and installing the binary**

The following command is a simple way to install `kubectl` on your Linux system by downloading the binary.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
```
{% endcode %}

Once you have the `kubectl` binary downloaded, install it by first making the binary executable:

```bash
$ chmod +x ./kubectl
```

Then, move the file into the system `bin` directory:

```bash
$ sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```



{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

If you would prefer to install Kubernetes using a Native Package Manager, please view [the Kubernetes guide on Installing using Native Package Manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/#install-using-native-package-management).
{% endhint %}

\
**Verifying the kubectl binary**

If you'd like to verify kubectl, you can verify it by running a checksum operation on the downloaded file prior to installing it, such as:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
echo "$(<kubectl.sha256) kubectl" | sha256sum --check
```
{% endcode %}



This should return `kubectl: OK` to confirm the file is indeed valid. If this returns an error, please review the [official `kubectl` installation guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="macOS" %}
## Installing `kubectl` on a macOS system

****

**Installing using Homebrew**

Most Mac users use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install packages.

If you do not already have Homebrew installed, follow the [Brew Installation](https://brew.sh) guide to do so, then install `kubectl` using Homebrew by running the following command:

```bash
$ brew install kubectl
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Windows" %}
## Installing `kubectl` on a Windows system

****

**Installing using PowerShell**

Using PowerShell, `kubectl` can be installed by using the following the command:\


{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```powershell
& $([scriptblock]::Create((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreweave/kubernetes-cloud/master/getting-started/k8ctl_setup.ps1')))
```
{% endcode %}



{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

Add the `-Silent` flag to the end of this string for a non-interactive setup.
{% endhint %}

****\
**Installing using a Package Manager**

You can also install `kubectl` on Windows using a package manager such as [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) or [Scoop](https://scoop.sh).



**Using** [**Chocolatey**](https://chocolatey.org)**:**

```powershell
$ choco install kubernetes-cli
```

**Using** [**Scoop**](https://scoop.sh)**:**

```powershell
$ scoop install kubectl
```

If you would prefer to download the `kubectl` executable directly, [follow the official Kubernetes instructions to download the latest version](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/#install-kubectl-binary-with-curl-on-windows).
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Configure Kubernetes

Finally, once you [have `kubectl` installed](getting-started.md#installing-the-kubernetes-command-line-tools), and the `cw-kubeconfig` file has been [generated and downloaded](getting-started.md#generate-the-kubeconfig-file), the next step is to move this config file to the right location.

By default, `kubectl` looks for a file named `config` (also referred to as a Kubeconfig file) in the `$HOME/.kube` directory.

<details>

<summary>I do not have a <code>~/.kube/config</code> file</summary>

If this is your first time using Kubernetes, or you're using a system that has never had Kubernetes configured before, you probably don't have a Kubeconfig file. You can check to see if you do by inspecting the Kubeconfig default path:

```bash
ls ~/.kube/config
```

If you **do not** have a Kubeconfig file, all you need to do is create the `~/.kube` directory if it does not already exist, and then move the downloaded `cw-kubeconfig` to the `~/.kube/config` path:

```bash
mkdir ~/.kube && mv ~/Downloads/cw-kubeconfig ~/.kube/config
```

If for some reason you would like to use a different path for the config file for your cluster, you can export the `$KUBECONFIG` environment variable. For example:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/cw-kubeconfig
```

Or, you can specify a path using the `--kubeconfig` option with `kubectl`.

</details>

<details>

<summary>I have an existing Kubeconfig file</summary>

If you **already have an existing Kubeconfig file,** you can install the CoreWeave Kubernetes credentials by merging the `cw-kubeconfig` file into `~/.kube/config`.

To do this, first create a backup copy of the original Kubeconfig file:

```shell
$ cp ~/.kube/config ~/.kube/config.bak
```

Next, merge the downloaded `cw-kubeconfig` file into the file at the default path using `kubectl`:

```bash
$ KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config:~/Downloads/cw-kubeconfig \
kubectl config view --merge --flatten > ~/.kube/config
```

</details>

### Paths for Windows and macOS

If you are working on a system other than a Linux system, replace `~/.kube/config` path with one of the corresponding paths below. Be sure to replace the `~/Downloads` path in this example with the actual location of your downloaded Kubeconfig file, and the default path with the one that is applicable to your system.

#### Default Kubernetes configuration directories by OS

| Operating System | Default path                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Linux            | `~/.kube/config`                 |
| macOS X          | `/Users/<username>/.kube/config` |
| Windows          | `%USERPROFILE%\.kube\config`     |

### Verify Kubernetes credentials

Since your new account will not yet have any resources, listing your [cluster `secrets`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) is a good way to test that proper communication with the cluster is in place. To verify your CoreWeave Kubernetes configuration using `kubectl`, invoke the following commands.

First, set [the Kubernetes context](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/#context) to `coreweave`:

```bash
$ kubectl config set-context coreweave
```

Next, request [the `secret` objects](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/):

```bash
$ kubectl get secret
```

This should return your default `secrets`, such as:

```
NAME                           TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
default-token-frqgm            kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      3h
```
