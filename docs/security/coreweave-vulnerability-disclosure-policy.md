# CoreWeave Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

## Purpose

To allow for the reporting and disclosure of vulnerabilities discovered by external entities, and anonymous reporting of information security policy violations by internal entities.&#x20;

## Scope

CoreWeave’s Responsible Disclosure Policy applies to CoreWeave’s core platform and its information security infrastructure, and to internal and external employees or third parties.&#x20;

## Introduction&#x20;

CoreWeave, Inc. (CoreWeave) welcomes feedback from security researchers and the general public to help improve our security. If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability, privacy issue, exposed data, or other security issues in any of our assets, we want to hear from you. This policy outlines steps for reporting vulnerabilities to us, what we expect, what you can expect from us.&#x20;

## Applicability

This policy applies to any digital assets owned, operated, or maintained by CoreWeave, Inc. (CoreWeave).&#x20;

## Out of scope

Assets or other equipment not owned by parties participating in this policy.&#x20;

Vulnerabilities discovered or suspected in out-of-scope systems should be reported to the appropriate vendor or applicable authority.&#x20;

Vulnerabilities which do not meet Coreweave's reporting standards or where no clearly articulable risk is present (i.e. Click-jacking with no security impact).

### What you can expect from CoreWeave

When working with us, according to this policy, you can expect us to:&#x20;

* Respond to your report promptly, and work with you to understand and validate your report
* Strive to keep you informed about the progress of a vulnerability as it is processed
* Work to remediate discovered and validated vulnerabilities in a timely manner, within our operational constraints
* Extend [Safe Harbor](coreweave-vulnerability-disclosure-policy.md#safe-harbor) for your vulnerability research that is related to this policy
* Credit after the vulnerability has been validated and fixed.&#x20;

### What we would like to see from you

In participating in our vulnerability disclosure program in good faith, we ask that you:&#x20;

* Play by the rules, including following this policy and any other relevant agreements. If there is any inconsistency between this policy and any other applicable terms, the terms of this policy will prevail.
* Report any vulnerability you’ve discovered promptly.
* Take all precautions to avoid violating the privacy of others, disrupting our systems, destroying data, and/or harming user experience; should any of these occur, report the incident to CoreWeave immediately.
* Use only the Official Channels to discuss vulnerability information with us.
* Provide us a reasonable amount of time (at least 90 days from the initial report) to resolve the issue before you disclose it publicly.
* Perform testing only on in-scope systems, and respect systems and activities which are out-of scope.
* If a vulnerability provides unintended access to data:
  * Limit the amount of data you access to the minimum required for effectively demonstrating a Proof of Concept;
  * cease testing and submit a report immediately if you encounter any user data during testing, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Personal Healthcare Information (PHI), credit card data, or proprietary information.
* You should only interact with test accounts you own or with explicit permission from the account holder.
* Do not engage in extortion.

If, during the course of participating in our program, you do not or are unable to perform the aforementioned precautions, you must report this to us immediately.

## Official Channels&#x20;

### How to submit a vulnerability&#x20;

To submit a vulnerability report to CoreWeave’s Product Security Team, please utilize the following email: [security@coreweave.com](mailto:security@coreweave.com), and provide all relevant information. The more details you provide, the easier it will be for us to triage and fix the issue.

## Vulnerability report and disclosure

### Preference, prioritization, and acceptance criteria&#x20;

We will use the criteria from the next sections to prioritize and triage submissions.

### What we would like to see from you

* Well-written reports in English will have a higher probability of resolution.
* Reports that include proof-of-concept code equip us to better triage.
* Reports that include only crash dumps or other automated tool output may receive lower priority.
* Reports that include products not on the initial scope list may receive lower priority.
* Please include how you found the bug, the impact, and any potential remediation.
* Please include any plans or intentions for public disclosure.&#x20;

## Safe Harbor

When conducting vulnerability research, according to this policy, we consider this research conducted under this policy to be:

* Authorized concerning any applicable anti-hacking laws, and we will not initiate or support legal action against you for accidental, good-faith violations of this policy;
* Authorized concerning any relevant anti-circumvention laws, and we will not bring a claim against you for circumvention of technology controls;
* Exempt from restrictions in our Terms of Service (TOS) and/or Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP) that would interfere with conducting security research, and we waive those restrictions on a limited basis
* Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the Internet, and conducted in good faith.&#x20;

You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws. If legal action is initiated by a third party against you and you have complied with this policy, we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.&#x20;

If at any time you have concerns, or are uncertain whether your security research is consistent with this policy, please submit a report through one of our [Official Channels](coreweave-vulnerability-disclosure-policy.md#official-channels) before going any further.&#x20;
