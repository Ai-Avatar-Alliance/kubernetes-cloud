# Tensorizer Benchmarks

[CoreWeave's Tensorizer](../../tensorizer.md) is a module, model, and tensor serializer and deserializer that makes it possible to load models in less than five seconds, making it easier, more flexible, and more cost-efficient to serve models at scale.

Each guide includes a link to the source code for the provided example. In most cases, it will be required to clone the repository in order to follow along directly with the tutorial's walkthrough.

### Benchmark tutorials

| [Real World Impact Benchmark](real-world-impact-benchmark.md) | In this tutorial, two inference services are created - one which uses Tensorizer, and one which does not. This benchmark provides comparative metrics on average response time and autoscaling capabilities. |
