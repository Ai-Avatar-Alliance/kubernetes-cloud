# Argo Workflows

Argo Workflows is an [open-source workflow orchestrator](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows) that runs on Kubernetes. It allows you to define complex, multi-step workflows as code and manage them in a scalable, fault-tolerant, and highly available manner. Argo Workflows is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://cncf.io/) hosted project.

You can deploy Argo Workflows from the CoreWeave [Applications Catalog](https://apps.coreweave.com/).&#x20;
