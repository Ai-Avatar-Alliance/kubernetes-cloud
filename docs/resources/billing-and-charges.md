# Billing and Charges

Billing and resource consumption are calculated on a per-minute basis. There is no minimum resource charge.

#### GPU Instance Billing

For Pods/Instances with a GPU attached, the rate of billing is determined by the price of the GPU per hour. The GPU price per hour, as listed on the [CoreWeave Cloud Pricing](https://coreweave.com/cloud/#pricing) page, includes the host device vCPU, RAM and ephemeral storage allocations.

**CPU Instance Billing**

For Pods/Instances without a GPU attached, the rate of billing is determined by the number of vCPU cores requested, or the current actual vCPU core usage, whichever is higher.

**Billing Periods**

All CoreWeave Cloud billing periods cover the calendar month \(i.e. 1 January 12:00am UTC thru 1 February 12:00am UTC\).
