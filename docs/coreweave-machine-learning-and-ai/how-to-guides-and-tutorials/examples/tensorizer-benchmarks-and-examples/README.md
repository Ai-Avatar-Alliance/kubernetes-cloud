# Tensorizer Benchmarks and Examples

[CoreWeave's Tensorizer](../../../inference/tensorizer.md) is a module, model, and tensor serializer and deserializer that makes it possible to load models in less than five seconds, making it easier, more flexible, and more cost-efficient to serve models at scale.

## Tensorizer benchmark tutorial directory

Each guide includes a link to the source code for the provided example. In most cases, it will be required to clone the repository in order to follow along directly with the tutorial's walkthrough.
