[Determined AI](https://www.determined.ai/) is an open-source deep learning training platform that makes building models fast and easy. Determined AI can now be deployed directly onto CoreWeave Cloud by deploying the application from [the application Catalog](https://apps.coreweave.com).

With Determined AI, you can [launch Jupyter notebooks](../how-to-guides-and-tutorials/model-training-guides/determined-ai-guides/launch-jupyter-notebook-on-coreweave-via-determined-ai.md), create interactive shells with VSCode support, and conduct distributed training experiments right from the Web UI or using CLI tools.

Deploying Determined AI from [the CoreWeave applications Catalog](https://apps.coreweave.com) makes spinning up an instance fast and easy. When running, the platform consumes minimal resources, incurring minimal cost.
