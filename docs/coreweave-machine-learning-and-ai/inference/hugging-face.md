[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) provides open source, state-of-the-art Machine Learning resources for [JAX](broken-reference), [PyTorch](pytorch-jax.md) and [TensorFlow](tensorflow.md), via projects such as [Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) and [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).

Diffusers provides pre-trained diffusion models that act as a modular toolbox for inference and training of diffusion models that can be applied across audio and visuals, while Transformers provides thousands of pre-trained models to perform tasks on text, visuals, and audio.
