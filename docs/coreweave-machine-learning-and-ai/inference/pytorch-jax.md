[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an open source machine learning framework. It is an optimized tensor library for deep learning using GPUs and CPUs. This section contains a few instructional walkthroughs on using use PyTorch on CoreWeave Cloud for machine learning and deep learning projects.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

Use `pip` to install PyTorch bundled with CUDA. Do not install CUDA separately, as doing so may result in dependency mismatches.

For more information, refer to the[ PyTorch installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
