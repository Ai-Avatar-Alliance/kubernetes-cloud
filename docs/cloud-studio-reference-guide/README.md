**Note**

These guides are intended as introductions to fundamental concepts, which can then further built upon. Where applicable, references to additional documentation have been provided in order to further explain configuration options and deployment methods.

## Getting Started with VFX Cloud studios

Like any VFX studio, CoreWeave Cloud studios are comprised of multiple parts, each of which is discussed in depth within this guide. The diagram below offers a visual example of how each part works together within the Cloud.

## Authenticating using Active Directory

The examples contained within this guide assume a few things about the Cloud studio setup. For starters, it is assumed that authentication is desired, so for many of the examples throughout this guide, Active Directory is used for user management and authentication. As such, we have already [provisioned an Active Directory domain](../virtual-servers/examples/active-directory-environment-hosted-on-coreweave-cloud/provision-an-active-directory-domain-controller.md), which is required to use Active Directory for user authentication.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Tip**

Setting up an Active Directory domain may be a good place to start when setting up your Cloud studio, but you can also come back later to configure Active Directory after you have set up the other components.
