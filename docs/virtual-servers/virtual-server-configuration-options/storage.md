# Storage

High-performance, network-attached storage for both [containerized workloads](https://docs.coreweave.com/coreweave-kubernetes/getting-started) and Virtual Servers is easy to provision and manage on CoreWeave Cloud. Available in both all-NVMe and HDD tiers, Storage Volumes can be created as Block Volumes or Shared File System Volumes, and can be resized at any time. Storage is managed separately from compute resources, and can be moved between instances and hardware types.
