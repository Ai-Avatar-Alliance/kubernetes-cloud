# Media Shuttle

## Media Shuttle

[Media Shuttle](https://www.signiant.com/products/media-shuttle/) makes it easy to share and receive media from outside parties. The MediaShuttle service may be used with your own subscription, or you may acquire a license via CoreWeave by [contacting your CoreWeave Support Specialist](https://cloud.coreweave.com/contact).

### Setup

Once you have a working Media Shuttle license, locate your Media Shuttle registration key.

Open Media Shuttle. Click **Add**, beside Storage.

Once you have completed the following steps in the wizard, the storage server registration key will be presented to you. Retain this for the next few setup steps.

Return to [the Applications Catalog](../../../../welcome-to-coreweave/coreweave-cloud-ui/applications-catalog.md), and search for **media-shuttle**. Find the **media-shuttle** application, select it, then click the **Deploy** button in the bottom right corner of the screen to begin configuring the application.

Update the name and the acquired registry key, then select the storage volume to add at the bottom of the configuration screen. Finally, click the **Deploy** button at the bottom of the screen to launch the deployment.

Once the deployment has completed, you will be automatically redirected to the Media Shuttle deployment status page. Once this status page shows that the Media Shuttle Pod is ready, you are ready to use the deployment.
