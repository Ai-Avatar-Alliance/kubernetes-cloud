# Get Started with VFX Studios

CoreWeave Cloud provides all the infrastructure needed to deploy an end-to-end VFX production pipeline in the Cloud. Host solutions entirely on CoreWeave Cloud, or integrate them with existing pipelines hosted elsewhere.

## Features

* ****:calendar\_spiral: **** [**Managed Thinkbox Deadline**](deadline.md) - One click deployment of a fully managed [Thinkbox Deadline](https://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/10.1/1\_User%20Manual/manual/overview.html) instance running in the cloud. Connect local artists via the Remote Connection Server.
* ****:arrow\_up: **Auto-Scaling Render Workers** - Powerful GPU and CPU render workers with no idle charges. Industry's fastest auto-scale starts your task on hundreds of GPUs or thousands of CPUs in 30 seconds, and scales them down once finished.
* ****:desktop: [**Virtual Workstations**](../../../virtual-servers/getting-started.md) - Linux and Windows high performance workstations with NVIDIA GPUs for editing, compositing and modeling work with direct access to storage and render capacity. Workstations come pre-loaded with [Teradici](https://www.teradici.com) or Parsec for multi monitor 4K support. New workstations can be instantiated in a minute, and stopped when the work-day is over.
* :muscle: [**High Performance Storage**](../../storage/storage/) - Shared file systems optimized for VFX feeding render workers and virtual workstations at wire speed. All storage is replicated to prevent data loss, and both ultra high performance NVMe and HDD storage is available.
* ****:globe\_with\_meridians: [**Low Latency Datacenters**](../../data-center-regions.md) - Data center locations in New York City, Chicago and Las Vegas guarantee a low-latency Virtual Workstation experience for remote employees.
