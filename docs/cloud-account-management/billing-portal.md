## About the portal

The billing portal has two main sections, **Subscriptions** and **Invoices**.&#x20;

* The **Subscriptions** section displays the charges for the current month. These charges update throughout the month as resources are used.
* The **Invoices** section has the invoice history for prior months.

Here's an example of the Subscriptions section.
