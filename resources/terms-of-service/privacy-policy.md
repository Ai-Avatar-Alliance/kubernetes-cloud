# Privacy Policy

{% hint style="info" %}
**Last Updated**

This policy was last updated on **October 5, 2022**.
{% endhint %}

This Privacy Policy describes how CoreWeave ("CoreWeave," "we," "our" or "us") collects, uses, and shares information in connection with a customer’s or user’s use of or access to our websites (“Sites”), platforms, applications, services, and solutions (collectively, the "Services"). When you access or use our Services or otherwise disclose information to CoreWeave, we will handle your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By using any of our Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.

**This Privacy Policy does not address or govern a customer’s “Processed Customer Data,” which is different from the information a customer provides or we collect when a customer interacts with our Sites.** Processed Customer Data is data processed by CoreWeave on behalf of the customer during the customer’s access and use of the Services. Each customer that opens an account and accepts the Terms of Service for use of the Services controls and is responsible for the collection, use and disclosure of its Processed Customer Data.

We recommend that you read this Privacy Policy in full to ensure you are fully informed. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or CoreWeave's collection, use, and disclosure practices, please contact us at privacy@coreweave.com.

We may automatically collect information about your use of features of our Services, about the functionality of our Services, frequency of visits to our Sites, and other information related to your interactions with the Services and our Sites.

We may track your use across different websites and services. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies or similar tracking tools by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies.

Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies or similar tracking tools, this could affect the functionality of certain Services or supporting you in your use of the Services. Some of our business partners may use cookies, tokens or other tracking technologies on our Sites. However, we have no access to or control over such tracking technologies used by a third-party.

This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies, tokens and other similar tracking technologies by CoreWeave only, and does not cover the use of cookies, tokens or other similar tracking technologies by any third-party services.

#### **II. Usage of our Services**

When you use our Services, we may collect information about your engagement with and utilization of our Services, such as processor and memory usage, storage capacity, navigation of our Services, and system-level metrics. We use this data to operate the Services, maintain and improve the performance and utilization of the Services, develop new products and features, protect the security, safety and accessibility of our Services and our customers, and provide customer support. We also use this data to develop aggregate analysis and business intelligence that enable us to operate, protect, make informed decisions, and report on the performance of our business.

When you access or use the Services, our servers automatically record certain log file information, such as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, operating system, browser type and language, referring URLs, access times, pages viewed, links clicked and other information about your activities on the Services.

### Information We Receive from Third Parties

If you choose to link our Services to a third-party account, we will receive information about that account, such as your authentication token from the third-party account, to authorize linking. If you wish to limit the information available to us, you should visit the privacy settings of your third-party accounts to learn about your options. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through or by any third party.

Once de-identified and aggregated so that data does not personally identify you (for example, we may aggregate data in order to improve our automation and improve care), it is no longer personal information.

Information may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to any potential acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any proposed merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, or in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets.

* **With Your Consent**. We may share information with your consent.

## 4. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information

Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you such as a purchase order for on-demand, reserved compute instances or bulk credits; (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights; or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.

We have a legitimate interest in operating our Services and communicating with you as necessary to provide these Services, for example when responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

## 5. Third-party Services

You may access other third-party services through our Sites or your use of the Services, for example by clicking on links to those third-party services from within our Sites or if a third-party service has been integrated with the Services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these third-party services, and we encourage you to carefully review their privacy policies. The fact that we may link to a third-party website or integrate or configure a solution or tool into the Services from a third party is not an endorsement, authorization, or representation of any affiliation by us with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.

## 6. Security

CoreWeave is committed to protecting your information. To do so, we employ a variety of security technologies and measures designed to protect information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.  We follow industry standards on information security management to safeguard sensitive information, such as personal information entrusted to us.  The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. However, please bear in mind that the Internet and any online platform cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information.

## 7. Data Retention

We retain personal information we collect from you where we have a legal obligation or an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need or legal obligation to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in standard backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.&#x20;

If you have any questions about the retention of your personal data, you can contact CoreWeave at [privacy@coreweave.com](mailto:privacy@coreweave.com).

## 8. Your Data Protection Rights Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

Data protection law in certain jurisdictions differentiates between the "controller" and "processor" of information. In general, you are the controller of the “Processed Customer Data” (described above in this Privacy Policy) that you upload to the Services and CoreWeave is the processor of such disclosed information.

CoreWeave is the controller of information it collects directly or indirectly from you through the Sites or non-Processed Customer Data collected directly or indirectly through your use of the Services. If you are an individual and a resident of the EEA, you have the following data protection rights:

* **Access/Correction/Deletion of Your Data.** If you wish to access, correct, update, or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by emailing [privacy@coreweave.com](mailto:privacy@coreweave.com).
* **Objection/Restriction of Certain Processing.** You can object to the processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information, or request portability of your personal information by emailing [privacy@coreweave.com](mailto:privacy@coreweave.com).
* **Withdrawal of Consent to Process.** If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, without a separate legal basis under the GDPR to process your data, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
* **File a Complaint.** You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.

We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

However, if CoreWeave receives data through a third party or a customer of its Services, CoreWeave has no direct relationship with the individual whose personal data it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, should direct their query to the third party or CoreWeave customer within whose account such individual’s data exists (the data controller).

CoreWeave currently utilizes Standard Contractual Clauses in connection with transfers of data from the EEA to the US. Please also refer to our Data Processing Agreement (CoreWeave as Controller) for more information about data transfers. The processing of personal data through cookies, tokens and similar tracking technologies (as described in this Privacy Policy) is strictly necessary for the purpose of preventing fraud and providing fraud-prevention security measures for individuals.

## 9. California Resident Rights

If you are a California resident, applicable state law may provide you with additional rights regarding our use of your personal information.

#### I. California Resident Rights

Subject to certain exceptions under California law, California residents may have the following rights with respect to their personal information collected by CoreWeave:

**Right to Delete.** The right to request that CoreWeave delete the personal information that we or our vendors collected about you. There may be circumstances under which we will be unable to delete your personal information, such as if we need to comply with our legal obligations or complete a transaction for which your personal information was collected. If we are unable to comply with your request for deletion, we will let you know the reason why.

**Right to Correct.** The right to request that CoreWeave correct the personal information that we or our vendors collected about you.

**Right to Restrict Sensitive Information Processing.** The right to request that CoreWeave restrict the use and disclosure of your sensitive personal information (as defined under California law).

**Right to Equal Service.** If you choose to exercise any of these rights, CoreWeave will not discriminate against you in any way. If you exercise certain rights, you may be unable to use or access certain features of the Services.

#### **II. Exercising Your Rights**

To exercise any of these rights, submit an email request to [privacy@coreweave.com](mailto:privacy@coreweave.com), or, if you are a user of the Services, you may submit a request through the chat function.

In connection with submitting a request, you must provide the following information:

* name
* email address
* phone number
* address

and you must state what type of request you are making.

Your legally authorized representative may make a request on your behalf related to your personal information. CoreWeave will take steps to verify your identity prior to processing your request, and we may ask for additional information from you that helps us with this verification.

CoreWeave cannot respond to a request or provide personal information if we cannot verify the identity or authority to make the request. In addition, if CoreWeave receives data through a third party or a customer of its Services, CoreWeave has no direct relationship with the individual whose personal information it processes.

An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct or delete data, should direct their query to the third party or CoreWeave customer within whose account such individual’s data exists (the data controller). If we deny a request, we will provide a response explaining the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.

#### **III. Sharing of California Resident Personal Information**

CoreWeave may have collected and disclosed the following categories of personal information from a California resident for a business purpose: various identifiers, including: name, address, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, or other similar identifiers.

Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e)), including telephone number or financial information.

Internet or other similar network activity, including, browsing history, search history, information on a consumer’s interaction with a website, application, or advertisement, including protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our Services (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data in order to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer our Services. Geolocation data, including, physical location or movements.

Professional or employment-related information, including, current or past job history or performance evaluations. Educational information, including, transcript, student records, grades and performance, activities, school name or school ID.

You have the right to opt-out of the disclosure of your personal information with a third party for cross-contextual behavioral advertising purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to [privacy@coreweave.com](mailto:privacy@coreweave.com).

#### **V. How We Respond to “Do Not Track” Signals**

Some web browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature or similar features that allow you to tell each website you visit that you do not want your activities on that website tracked. At present, the Sites and Services do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals and consequently, the Sites and Services will continue to collect information about you even if your browser’s “Do Not Track” feature is activated.

#### **VI. “Shine the Light” Law**

California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our Services that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to [privacy@coreweave.com](mailto:privacy@coreweave.com).

## **12. Changes to this Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time, so please review it frequently. Changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on our Sites. If we materially change the ways in which we use or share personal information previously collected from you through our Services, we will notify you through our Services, by email, or other communication.
